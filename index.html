<p>I&#039;ve had the pleasure of working with Dan on-and-off for almost 15 years. His capacity to stay—seemingly effortlessly—on the pulse of technology, as well as foresee technology&#039;s social and economic impacts, has made him the best person throughout my career to think big with and look ahead in time with.
Dan&#039;s ability to apply this knowledge and foresight to business problems and strategy has always quickly solidified him as thought leader and amongst his peers, one of incredible philosophical and bottom line benefit.
As a people leader, Dan is remarkably rational, diplomatic and emotionally intelligent. He is a leader I hope to work with again in the future.</p>

<p>In my role as GM - Online Strategy &amp; Services at Tatts Group, I had the pleasure of reporting directly to Dan, and working closely with him every day.
Dan is a level headed leader with an extraordinary eye for emerging markets, particularly in the digital space. He is a passionate technologist, with a strong awareness of cutting edge technologies and how they can be best applied to deliver innovative new experiences to his customers.
Dan is able to strike a balance between technology and commercial/product strategy that is extremely valuable in our increasingly digital world, and he is a capable champion for projects that might otherwise be considered challenging or difficult. His ability to maintain close and amiable relationships with his staff and stakeholders is also an extremely valuable asset.</p>

<div class="testimonial-text">
<p>Dan&#039;s the type of guy you meet at computer club and instantly go &quot;I want to hang out with him more&quot; as he&#039;s fascination with not just the latest tech trends but then how they apply to the context of the day is exceptionally insightful. I counted on Dan not just as my manager but also a friend &amp; professional peer - and will continue to do so - and found that he was able to challenge me often on my ideas &amp; approach to problems. Dan has a lot of layers to his approach to leadership and doesn&#039;t miss details no matter how many times I watched folks attempt to slip past him. He&#039;s not quick to punish but at the same time he&#039;ll not take laziness or incompetence as an acceptable approach to work being asked to perform.
I also watched Dan under pressure and that is when you really see the leaderships come out strongly, as not only did he stand at his post when I&#039;d argue many would have quit, he was able to shape and augment the panic or stress in a way that altered its course towards resolutions and/or peace within the ranks. I&#039;ve worked with a lot of strong leaders and i&#039;d work with Dan again, in fact I hope to again.</p>

An Apple 2e. I was furious, everyone else had Commodore 64's! I learnt to accept it, and indeed loved it. Things really opened up when I joined the local Apple user group and each month they lent out a 300 baud modem. I still remember my first connection to Telstra's (Telecom at the time) "Viatel" service. When I handed the modem back I had rung up several hundred dollars worth on my parents phone bill... </div>

I convinced my parents to get a 2nd phone line and started my own BBS connected to FidoNet. Great learning experience that introduced me and my naturally curious mind to the world of Hacking and phone Phreaking. Overseas BBS's had the best "text files" from which to learn from, and I became friends with the "Sysop" of "Info Addict" - the largest repository of text files in Western Europe.

<div class="text">
At this stage in the online gambling scene there were only a few players, with CentreBet being one of the biggest. Octa4 had coded the website using an obscure scripting language with a single threaded pipeline to the back-end. We thought it would be cool if when a bet was placed the server would audibly play a Mac OS system noise (the "quack") - it really helped explain to the boss how much money he was making! Once the event started, we were swamped. The site was maxed out most of the time with constant "quacks". This was the start of something big, and I was prompted to the role of Web Project Manager (but in reality it was also Product Manager and Lead Developer) with primary responsibility to enable CentreBet to handle the load of the next big event. </div>

The team had your traditional web developers, but also BA's, Product Managers, Project Managers, a UX team and a Digital Marketing team focusing on SEM and SEO. We had a one stop digital shop brewing. </div>

With Robbie's arrival and the ramping up of digital staffing levels also came an independent analysis of both the wagering and lotteries business and if they should remain coupled in the form of Tatts.com. The result was a resounding no - wagering people never really played lotteries unless there was a big jackpot, and lotteries people did not want to be associated with wagering. The decision was made to create individual websites for both sides of the business. At the same time, the structure of the group was updated and my title changed to Chief Online Officer (my responsibilities stayed the same - just with more people!). </div>

With the split of Tatts.com it was seen as a good time to assist with the brand confusion in the marketplace around TattsBet (which was UNiTAB and is branded TAB in retail - the same as Tabcorp in NSW/VIC). After a long branding exercise, UBET was decided upon as the new brand for the wagering business. Out job was to create brand new digital apps for the business; web, mobile and tablet. iOS and Android. Using the latest tech, we created a responsive website and new apps and launch in April of 2015. </div>

Once the Agile transformation for the digital team was done and the UBET site launched, the decision was made to move the team back into the Technology division (which was now under new management and undergoing its own transformation).
After dragging the digital presence of Tatts Group from a handful of people to staffing levels of nearly 70, and with the responsibility of digital assets turning over more than a billion dollars a year for both wagering and lotteries, my journey was complete and I was looking forward to the next challenge.
After discussions with Tatts management I decided to take a role heading up a newly formed Innovation team. Our goal was to not only provide a mechanism for innovative ideas to flourish at Tatts, but to head up investigation into some key "edge" projects to ensure the business stays in front of the competition. </div>

We spent 6 months delving into great detail what the eSports scene was like, with Australia as our specific focus. We found that there was a large supply gap in the AU market, and the potential was certainly there for a new business.
We had a 4 hour pitch session with the CEO, CIO and CMO which was extremely well received, but just after that news broke of a potential buyout from TABCorp (whom already had a presence in this space) and the idea was put on hold. </div>

It had been an interesting ride at Tatts and I learnt so much there, but was glad to be moving on. I had started as a minor player and moved all the way to the C-level, and at the same time modernised the digital capability at the business to a stage where it could compete - not only with others in the market, but internally as well, showing the business the way forward truly is digital. </div>

<h4 class="item-title">My side project finally gets focus - and goes live!</h4>
<div class="text">
During the last year at Tatts I began work on what is now know as Ultim.
Ultim is a ketogenic meal replacement shake, that marries the convenience of a shake with the ability to stay in ketosis.
The last few years at Tatts had not been kind on my body, with stress and a lack of time leading to poor eating choices and an unflattering waistline! I decided to attack this problem like any other I encounter - do the research and find the optimum solution. The ketogenic diet seemed to be the best, and was increasingly being validated by all the newer reports coming out.
Put simply, I had to come up with an easy way to stay in ketosis (75% good fats, 20% protein, 5% carbs) as I found there were so many hidden sugars/carbs in the food that was readily available to me.
The end result is a shake that allows me to perfectly hit my macros, that taste good and is easy to consume, and has a few added benefits with the addition of certain nootropics that work well together with a brain fed by ketones.
I was losing a kilo a week without any exercise and because of the satiating nature of this way of eating, I was never hungry. That's when I decided to share this and sell it online, and we are in the process of setting this up now. </div>

I've now been mining for more than a year, have invested in various chains and tokens, and have done a deep dive into the world of ICO's (Initial Coin Offerings - similar to an IPO but in the blockchain space).
The potential for disruption not only to existing businesses, but to society as a whole is huge with this tech, and I can't wait to see what it all holds. </div>

After the hype and chaos of the ICO, I settled down into being the primary point guy for all things "HST" token.
This involved ensuring we were showing up properly and branded in the crypto ecosystem, and making sure the token economics were functioning as intended.
Apart from this, my main focus was making sure the token was trade-able on exchanges around the world. This called for a listing strategy, 3rd party engagement, regulatory checks and dodging companies of lesser reputation.
The culmination of this work was the listing of HST on Bittrex. The full story from this period of time in my working life can be found on my medium post <a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/the-evolution-of-the-hst-token-e6d707c5c156" target="new" rel="noopener">here</a>. </div>

<h4>Process Automation</h4>
<p>These days there are so many tools that can be used to assist us with our daily routines, and ensure we are completely focused on the task at hand - but they are often all sitting in their own silo-ed existence.
The ability to link and integrate tooling is one of my core strengths and passions.</p>

<h4>Innovation Framework</h4>
<p>In many companies, the best ideas can often come from the most unlikely of places. Ensuring a proper process of both receiving and evaluating these ideas is crucial if you want to stay competitive.
I can help implement an open innovation framework that enables a way to sort, test and move on only the best potential ideas for your business - ensuring you are always ahead of the market.</p>

<h4>Blockchain analysis</h4>
<p>Once you get past the buzzword of blockchain and crypto, and really dive into what is possible, the potential for disruption to businesses across the globe is quite stark.
As with any new innovation, you need to ensure that you are either moving with the times and potentially disrupting yourself, or be left behind.</p>

<p>With modern requirements increasingly calling for working flexibility, the remote working concept is being embraced more and more.</p>
<p>Whilst not all work is suitable, there is a wide array of IT work that is perfectly suited - and in fact, sometimes even more productivity can be had by having workers take more ownership over their time and working situation.</p>
<p>The old fear of worker slacking off has been debunked by most researchers in this space - especially when you are dealing with industry professionals - but there are best practices and automation tooling that can be put in place to ensure your business can get the most from this arrangement.</p>
<p>I've worked in various businesses, from large corporate environments to startups, and have spent many years working in office, completely remotely, or a hybrid of the two - as such, I have learnt many of the lessons on what works, what doesn't, and how a company can turn this aspect of their business into a real draw-card for employees.</p>

<p>With a properly integrated setup many manual tasks can be automated, and soon you can find your focus is laser sharp, and not being pulled in too many directions at once.
Ideally a central comms tool would pull in all your other tooling to give a one-stop-shop workview.</p>

The upside of this work is that once you have your routine setup and customised to your own needs, you are often far more productive that before.</p>
